# A list of butterfly species
butterflies = ["Monarch", "Swallowtail", "Painted Lady", "Blue Morpho"]

# A function that takes a list as input and prints each item
def print_list_items(lst):
    for item in lst:
        print(item)

# Call the function with the butterflies list
print_list_items(butterflies)

# Result of the function running:
# Monarch
# Swallowtail
# Painted Lady
# Blue Morpho

# Explanation:
# Lists are a way to store and work with collections of items in a program.
# They are versatile and can hold different types of elements.
# The code above demonstrates a list called 'butterflies' that contains 
# four elements representing butterfly species: "Monarch", "Swallowtail", 
# "Painted Lady", and "Blue Morpho".
# It also shows a function that prints each item in a given list.
# When the function is called with the 'butterflies' list, it prints the butterflies one by one.
# Lists are commonly used for storing and manipulating data, representing sequences, and more.
